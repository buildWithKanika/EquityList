# Equality List Project

## Introduction

This project is designed to manage equality lists effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing three types of ledger data: simple, complicated, and duplicate. These types of data have been identified based on the provided assignment, which seemed to contain three distinct categories of ledger data provided by bank api

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the 'equality-list' folder**: Use your command line interface to go into the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd equality-list
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**: Start the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Login Screen**: After running the application, open your web browser and access the login screen. The project should be running at `http://localhost:3000` by default. If the port is different, it will be displayed in your terminal.

## Usage

Once you have accessed the login screen, you have to give one the folowwing user name

- **Simple**: submit this user to view simple ledger data.

- **Complicated**:submit this user to view  complicated ledger data.

- **Duplicate**: submit this user to view  duplicate ledger data.

As per the assignment bank api can give the response which can be simple_ledger, duplicate_ledger , complicated_ledger.
For the purpose of how all of these different data will look on UI , i have considered there are three user **simple** , **complicated** and **Duplicate**
